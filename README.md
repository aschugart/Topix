# Topix

Topix is an iMessage extension ([a real thing in the upcoming iOS 10!](https://developer.apple.com/imessage/)) that will allow users to save important text messages into topics to refer to later. Forget the hassle of scrolling through endless texts just to find that single one with important information, and forget screenshotting your iMessages a bunch of times just to keep those few important texts available for future reference.

## Why Topix?

Because as a society we are moving more and more toward digital communication, and because more and more of that digital communication -- including important conversations -- is moving from emails to texts, it's critical for iMessage to keep up-to-date with the developing methods of digital communication. Think of gmail: you have the option to sort your emails into files, to star emails, etc. With iMessage that isn't possible -- and Topix is precisely the solution.

## How Does it Work?

 Topix will be a user to either tap and hold on a message and then save it into a certain topic, or to swipe the message to the right to be quickly added into the main Topix page (under "Starred", to later be sorted) -- which will allow for ease of saving messages while still in a rapid conversation. The main Topix page can be viewed by swiping from the main iMessage page. The main Topix page will bring up a list of all topic categories you have added (kind of like folders), and by clicking one of the topics, a new page will bring up all texts in that topic that you've added (can be texts from various people, if relevant, and those will be sorted accordingly). Note that the messages in Topix are merely a copy of the messages in your main threads, so it will not mess with your main iMessage text threads. 

## Wait, explain more. 

Topix is currently a work-in-progress, but the mockups are publicly available in this repo. They provide more detail about the functioning and layout of the iMessage extension.
